***The code from book in page 89:***
The code orchestrates the preparation of a multilingual dataset by sequentially loading individual language datasets from the XTREME
benchmark (specifically the PAN-X datasets). The datasets are then subject to shuffling and downsampling, 
the latter based on predetermined fractions corresponding to each language. 
The organized output comprises a nested 'DatasetDict' structure where language codes serve as the outer keys and data splits as the inner keys.
In - ["ar", "fr", "it", "en"] - These language codes are frequently used to represent the languages associated with various datasets or language-specific components in 
natural language processing projects in a variety of scenarios, including data processing projects.
